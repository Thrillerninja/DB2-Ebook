\chapter{Advantages and Disadvantages}

\section{Technical Advantages}

\textbf{Performance Metrics:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sub-millisecond key-value operations (<1ms @ 99th percentile)
  \item Memory-first architecture with configurable ejection policies
  \item B-tree based global secondary indexes for query optimization
  \item Write-optimized storage engine with append-only commits
  \item 30-40% storage reduction via snappy compression
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Technical Capabilities:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Multi-model support: K-V, document, spatial, full-text within single platform
  \item ANSI JOIN and NEST operations in N1QL with pushdown optimization
  \item Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR) with filtering and compression
  \item SSLv3/TLS 1.2+ encryption with FIPS 140-2 compliance
  \item SDK support for Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, Go with reactive extensions
\end{itemize}

\section{Technical Limitations}

\textbf{Performance Constraints:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Document size limit: 20MB (default)
  \item Memory overhead: ~56 bytes metadata per document
  \item Transaction latency: increased by 15-30\% for multi-document ACID
  \item Query performance degrades with >10 JOINs in single statement
  \item Minimum 4GB RAM recommended per node for production
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Architectural Considerations:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Default consistency: eventual for queries, strong for K-V operations
  \item CAP theorem positioning: CP for document operations, AP for cross-cluster
  \item Minimum 3 nodes recommended for high availability
  \item Scaling requires rebalance operations (minimal but measurable impact)
  \item Analytics segregation required for OLAP without OLTP impact
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Ideal Workloads:} High-throughput OLTP with sub-ms requirements; mixed document/K-V operations; distributed multi-model applications requiring SQL compatibility.

\textbf{Less Suitable:} Graph-centric applications (high relationship traversal); pure analytics workloads; single-server deployments with <8GB RAM.
